# Flood Susceptibility Mapping of Assam, India

This project focuses on developing a flood susceptibility mapping model for the state of Assam using a combination of GIS-based spatial analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to support disaster preparedness by identifying regions vulnerable to flooding based on historical and environmental data.

---

## Objective

To create a reliable and accurate predictive model for identifying flood-prone zones in Assam by integrating geospatial features with machine learning algorithms.

---

## Data Sources

The following publicly available datasets were used:

- [Bhuvan (NRSC)](https://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in)
- [Bhoonidhi (NRSC)](https://bhoonidhi.nrsc.gov.in)
- [CHRS Rainfall Data](https://chrsdata.eng.uci.edu)
- [Open Government Data Portal (India)](https://data.gov.in)

---

## Features Extracted

The model was trained on the following geospatial and environmental features derived using QGIS and remote sensing tools:

- Slope
- Topographic Roughness Index (TRI)
- Topographic Position Index (TPI)
- Distance from River
- Rainfall
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
- Land Use / Land Cover (LULC)

---

## Methodology

1. Historical flood inventory was created using known flood-prone and flood-free locations (100 each).
2. Feature extraction was performed using QGIS tools and raster processing.
3. Machine learning models were trained and validated using a stratified split (159 training points, 41 testing points).
4. Performance was assessed using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and PA/UA scores.

## Models and Performance

| Model                        | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Random Forest               | 97.50        |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)| 88.09        |
| Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)| 85.53        |

Random Forest yielded the best results in terms of classification accuracy, outperforming both SVM and MLP models.

---

## Results

- Successfully classified flood-prone regions with high confidence using spatial and temporal features.
- Random Forest model demonstrated strong generalization with 97.5% accuracy.
- The final susceptibility map enables visual interpretation and planning for flood mitigation.
